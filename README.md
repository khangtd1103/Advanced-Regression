## General Information
- A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. 
- The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. 
- The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market.
- The dataset being used are collected from the sale of houses in Australia.

## Conclusions
- Top 5 variables which are significant in predicting the price of a house are: GrLivArea, OverallQual, GarageArea, TotalBsmtSF, Neighborhood_NoRidge
- These variables can predict accurately at more than 84%. 
- Determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression which is 1 and 10 respectively.
